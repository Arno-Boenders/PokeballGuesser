# PokeballGuesser
 ### What is PokeballGuesser
PokeballGuesser is a little project that was made in the course Web Topics Advanced. We needed to use multiple topics that we chose to make a project we wanted. I chose to make a game where you need to guess the amount of pokeballs there are. I used Three.js to spawn the pokeballs, this way the player can look around and the difficulty gets boosted. To store the data from the player I used firebase/firestore. After 3 tries you get redirected to a results page where you will see graphs with your results, this is done with graph.js.
 
 ### How to play
 You can just clone the code and then run: npm install
 
 You need to change window.location.href on lines 263 and 317 to "/results.html"
 
 after this you can just use: npm run dev
 
 and you can play the game
